## Introduction

<div>

<br>

Dataset obtained from an article (Borovecki et al. 2005) about the correlation between the expression of different genes with the development of Huntington's disease.

Dataset content:

-   x: Probes IDs and gene expression values of each sample

-   y: Diagnosis (symptomatic, control)

The desired output to start working with the dataset is a tibble with tidy data:

1.  Each row is an observation
2.  Each column is a variable
3.  Each cell is a single value

</div>

## Materials and methods

#### Wrangling I Initial tibble

<br>

With the data that we had, we created a tibble, where X is now a new column containing the samples from the microarray in order and Y is a new column containing the diagnosis of the patient in that respective sample.

Apart from that we have different columns for each sample representing all the genes from each one.

<br>

```{r eval=FALSE}

borovecki <- borovecki$x |>
  as_tibble() |>
  mutate(
    sample = row_number(), 
    .before = 1, 
    diagnosis = borovecki$y
  )

borovecki <- borovecki |>
  pivot_longer(
    cols = ends_with("at"),
    names_to = "probeID", 
    values_to = "expressionValue",
    values_drop_na = TRUE
  )
```

## Materials and methods

#### Wrangling II Pivot_longer

<br>

We make use of the pivot function in order to get all the columns containing the different genes and including them all in the same column called probeID and placing the values from the different probe IDs into a new column called expressionValue.

<br>

```{r eval=FALSE}
borovecki <- borovecki |>
  pivot_longer(
    cols = ends_with("at"),
    names_to = "probeID", 
    values_to = "expressionValue",
    values_drop_na = TRUE
  )
```

## Materials and methods

#### Bioconductor

<br>

The hgu133a.db package is useful to handle Affymetrix Human Genome U133A Microarrays as it allows us to do many different annotations.

In our case, thanks to the hgu133a.db package, we were able to annotate all the different probe IDs into real gene names so that the posterior work was done more easily.

<br>

```{r eval=FALSE}
#| message = FALSE
borovecki <- borovecki |>
  mutate(
    gene = mapIds(
      hgu133a.db, 
      keys=probeID, 
      keytype = "PROBEID", 
      column="SYMBOL",
      multiVals="first"
    )
  ) |>
  filter(!is.na(gene)) |>
  # I specify the package because AnnotationDbi also has a select function
  dplyr::select(-probeID)
```

## Linear Modelling (Obtaining gene-level data)

<br>

Let `R` know that we want to work per gene, to do that we define a Linear Model, the analysis requires:

-   Tidy data, to obtain it we will pivot the wide format

```{r eval=FALSE}
borovecki_tibble_long <- borovecki_tibble  |> 
  pivot_longer(
    cols = -Diagnosis,
    names_to = "gene",
    values_to = "log2_expr_level"
  ) |>
  mutate(
    log2_expr_level = log2(log2_expr_level)
  )
```

-   Group the tidy data by gene and then add the nest() and ungroup() functions to your pipeline

```{r eval=FALSE}
borovecki_tibble_long_nested <- borovecki_tibble_long |> 
  group_by(gene) |> 
  nest() |> 
  ungroup()
```

## Fitting the model

<br>

We created a function that applies a linear model. Applying the function map() to the borovecki_tibble_long_nested *per* gene.

The result is a tibble where each row is a gene with two nested data frames.

-   The first one contains multiples rows with (diagnosis + log2_expr_level)

-   The second one contains the output of the linear function.

    <br>

```{r eval=FALSE}
borovecki_tibble_long <- borovecki_tibble  |> 
  pivot_longer(
    cols = -Diagnosis,
    names_to = "gene",
    values_to = "log2_expr_level"
  ) |>
  mutate(
    log2_expr_level = log2(log2_expr_level)
  )
```

## Discussion

<br>

-   Use of different functions in RStudio allowed us to tidy the initial raw dataset to work with it.

-   Combining our tidy data with the bibliography, allowed us to see the difference in the expressions by applying different plots.

    <br>

    #### Future perspectives

    <br>

-   This methodology could be translated for other diseases in the future.

-   More collaboration between hospitals and bioinformaticians to use the data they obtain in order to get a better understanding of how different diseases work.
