# Group 04 Project

### Description:

The aim of this project is to use an untidy data set extracted from an article (Borovecki et al. 2005) and do the necessary steps to make it tidy. After that, it will be of interest to use it to find some possible correlations and plot them, so that it is easier to visualize for the people that will be looking at our project.

### Folders:

In this project the following folders and content can be found:

data/ -\> Original data set used in the article (raw) and tibble showing all the different genes and its expression values for the 31 different samples.

R/ -\> Data processing Quarto document where it is explained step by step how the data has been processed in order to make it tidy and obtain the table (found in data/).

results/ -\> All the correlations and different plots and tibbles that have been found analyzing the data after it has been tidied.

README.md -\> This file

### Contributing:

The processed data set can be used by other users to try to find more correlations, plotting them or making them into a tibble with the desired data. Also, to fix possible errors or bugs found in the code or suggest some new ideas.

In order to do so, the user should:

##### 1- Fork the repository

##### 2- Open a new branch of its own

##### 3- Commit its changes

##### 4- Push them to the branch

##### 5- Open a pull request
