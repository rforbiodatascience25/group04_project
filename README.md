### Description:

The aim of this project is to take an untidy microarray dataset from Borovecki et al. (2005) and perform all the necessary steps to convert it into a tidy format. Once the data is cleaned and organized, we use it to explore potential gene–disease associations through statistical modelling and visualizations. The final goal is to present the results in a clear and accessible way for anyone reviewing our analysis.

### Data Source:

The dataset is downloaded from the public GitHub repository ramhiser/datamicroarray, specifically the file borovecki.RData, retrieved from https://github.com/ramhiser/datamicroarray/tree/master/data.

### Folders:

In this project the following folders and content can be found:

_raw/ -\> Contains the original dataset used in the article (raw format).

data/ -\> Stores intermediate and final datasets saved as .rds files, ready to be used for the analysis.

doc/ -\> Includes Quarto presentation scripts, rendered HTML files, and additional supporting materials.

R/ -\> Contains Quarto documents that explain, step by step, how the data was processed to obtain a tidy structure. The main steps covered are:
- Data pre-processing
- Data tidying
- Linear modelling

results/ -\> Includes all plots, figures, and correlation analyses generated after tidying and modeling the data.

.gitignore -\> Specifies files and folders that are excluded from version control.

README.md -\> The file you are currently reading.

group04_project.Rproj -\> RStudio project file for easy navigation and reproducibility.
